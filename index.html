            <h2 class="section-title">Investment Philosophy</h2>
            
            <div class="philosophy-intro">
                <p>At Meridian Vault Partners, we operate at the intersection of cultural permanence and technological innovation. Our investment thesis is built on a fundamental premise: the world's most valuable assets are increasingly disconnected from the capital markets that could optimize their value. Through proprietary fractionalization protocols, we are eliminating the liquidity constraints that have historically restricted access to museum-quality art, iconic collectibles, and foundational digital artifacts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="philosophy-section">
                <h3>Core Principles</h3>
                <div class="principle-grid">
                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h4>1. Rigorous Due Diligence</h4>
                        <p>Every asset undergoes a minimum 90-day evaluation process incorporating forensic authentication, provenance verification, condition assessment, and market comparables analysis. Our acceptance rate is below 2.3%, ensuring only institutional-grade assets enter our portfolios. We employ a proprietary 47-point scoring matrix that synthesizes qualitative expert judgment with quantitative predictive modeling.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h4>2. Technology-First Infrastructure</h4>
                        <p>Our ChainCustody™ framework leverages immutable distributed ledger technology to create transparent, auditable ownership records. Each fractional token is cryptographically secured using AES-256 encryption and stored across geographically distributed cold storage nodes. Our smart contracts have undergone penetration testing by three independent cybersecurity firms and carry $50M in error and omission insurance.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h4>3. Uncorrelated Returns</h4>
                        <p>Cultural assets demonstrate statistically significant negative correlation with traditional equity indices (β = -0.12 vs S&P 500 over 20-year period). Our portfolios provide essential diversification benefits while maintaining target volatility below 15% annually. Backtested simulations indicate that a 15-20% allocation to fractionalized cultural assets improves Sharpe ratios by an average of 0.34 points.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h4>4. Active Portfolio Management</h4>
                        <p>Unlike passive buy-and-hold strategies, we continuously optimize holdings through algorithmic rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting, and strategic exits. Our quantitative team monitors over 400 market signals daily, including auction results, institutional acquisition patterns, media sentiment analysis, and macroeconomic indicators. This active approach has generated an average of 340 basis points of alpha annually since inception.</p>

                <h3>The Meridian Vault Advantage</h3>
                <p class="advantage-text">Traditional alternative investment platforms require minimum commitments of $5-10M and multi-year lock-up periods. We have reimagined this model entirely. Through tokenization, investors gain fractional exposure starting at $50,000 with quarterly redemption windows. Our proprietary secondary marketplace provides liquidity comparable to publicly traded securities while maintaining the tax advantages and portfolio characteristics of private alternative investments.</p>
                
                <p class="advantage-text">Furthermore, our vertical integration strategy eliminates costly middlemen. By maintaining direct relationships with auction houses, private collectors, and authentication experts, we reduce acquisition costs by approximately 18% versus traditional art investment funds. These savings flow directly to our investors through enhanced net returns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="philosophy-section">
                <h3>Risk Management Framework</h3>
                <p class="advantage-text">Cultural asset investment carries unique risks including authenticity concerns, physical damage, market illiquidity, and regulatory uncertainty. Our comprehensive risk mitigation strategy addresses each vector:</p>
                
                <ul class="risk-list">
                    <li><strong>Authenticity Risk:</strong> Multi-layered authentication combining forensic science, AI-powered brushstroke analysis, and consensus opinions from minimum three recognized experts per asset</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Risk:</strong> All assets stored in Tier IV+ climate-controlled facilities with 24/7 monitoring, seismic protection, and insurance coverage at 125% of appraised value</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> Diversification across 40+ assets, multiple categories, time periods, and geographic origins; mandatory 3-year minimum holding periods for core positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Ongoing engagement with SEC, FINRA, and international regulatory bodies; full compliance with Howey Test requirements and securities registration protocols</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology Risk:</strong> Redundant blockchain infrastructure, quarterly third-party security audits, bug bounty program, and comprehensive cybersecurity insurance</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="philosophy-cta">
